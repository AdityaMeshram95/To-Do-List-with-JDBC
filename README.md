# To-Do-List-with-JDBC
This mini Project I have made to store the daily schedule inside the Database
# BASE CLASS  
  1. A base class created inside which there are certains methods doing different work as per the reqirement we are going to call them in main method inside while(loop)
  2. 1st method is to create a table inside MySql is the table of the same name does not exist.
  3. 2nd method is to add the task inside the SQL table in the rows.
  4. 3rd method is to display those added task inside the java Console.
  5. 4th method is if we want to remove any task from the database.
  6. All these above methos are 'static'

# TEST CLASS
  1. created a main method
  2. created an object of scanner class
  3. While Loop (true){ } : took this loop so that program should run in an infinite loop until the user want to exit from it using System.exit(0) method.
  4. use 'switch case' to choose what task does the user want to perform then user will call those method by choosing the task number from the To-DO list menu.
